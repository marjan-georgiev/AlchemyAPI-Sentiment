Best of the best. Pete has crafted a masterpiece. I should say at this point, I am a new fan of LOTR movies after seeing this movie. My friends and family always told me I should watch the previous 3 films and now i cant wait to sit down with a bowl of popcorn and witness the magnificent scale and perfect execution that The Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey brought to all 5 senses of mine. Maybe I could count The Hobbit in as a SIXTH sense. It was just THAT good.

First of all, the 48fps was just beautifully sharp and clean to the eyes. It was a touch of technological wizardry by Jackson, and it worked perfectly, allowing the viewer to feel as he/she were a spying picture frame on Bilbo's fireplace, or a pine tree looking over a cliff and down at Rivendell. It seems far fetched, but lets just say I forgot I was watching a movie, and you can experience for yourself, what I mean.

The execution was fabulous as well; the pacing, the shot angles, the acting, the script, and so much more. The score by Howard Shore was so clever and is sure to put a smile on your face. The WHOLE movie will put a smile on your face. The Hobbit will remind you that you can do great things, no matter how small.
